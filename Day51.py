# Day51:

# *continue from yesterday linear Regression (Cost Function: J(θ) = (1/2m) * Σ(hθ(x(i)) - y(i))^2)

# *Convergence Algorithm:
# This algorithm iteratively refines a solution until it converges to a stable state.
# It is commonly used in optimization problems, numerical methods, and machine learning to find optimal parameters or solutions.
# The basic steps of a convergence algorithm are as follows:
# 1. Initialization: Start with an initial guess or estimate for the solution.
# 2. Iteration: Update the current estimate based on a specific rule or formula.
# 3. Convergence Check: Determine if the algorithm has converged by checking if the changes in the solution are below a certain threshold.
# 4. Termination: If converged, stop the algorithm and return the solution; otherwise, repeat the iteration step.
# Example: Gradient Descent
# Gradient descent is a popular convergence algorithm used in optimization problems, particularly in machine learning.
# It aims to minimize a loss function by iteratively updating the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.
