# **Categories of Machine Learning:
# - Based on Supervision: Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning

# *Unsupervised Learning:
# In this approach, the model is trained on unlabeled data, and it tries to find patterns or structures in the data without any explicit guidance on what the output should be.
# E.g: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

# *Semi-Supervised Learning:
# In this approach, the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. 
# It combines the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised learning.
# E.g: Text Classification, Image Classification with Limited Labels

# *Reinforcement Learning:
# In this approach, the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. 
# The model aims to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
# 
# E.g: Game Playing (e.g., AlphaGo), Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles
